Manhattan and Brooklyn dominate the listing volume and pricing spectrum.

Entire homes/apartments are priced significantly higher than private rooms.

Listings with moderate pricing receive higher review volumes, indicating better demand.

A small percentage of hosts own multiple listings, suggesting commercial activity.

High availability listings may indicate low demand or overpriced units.

📌 Business Recommendations

🏷️ Hosts should adopt competitive pricing strategies in high-density areas.

📍 New hosts can target Brooklyn & Queens for better price-demand balance.

🔁 Airbnb can monitor multi-listing hosts for policy compliance.

📉 Listings with high availability should be re-evaluated for pricing or quality.
